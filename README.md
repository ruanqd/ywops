operation system for operator

i am looking for a good Operation system for my daily work. I have tried some ,such as saltstack,ansible,jenkins,rundeck,stormstack,they are very good.but not good enough for me.there are some limits:
1.so terrible UI.So ugly,too hard to use,too clumsy.not so effective.
2. no realtime output,i have some background-running batch jobs,but also foreground commands.I need know what happend,do quick action.
3.can't work with cmdb.
4.just few functions.i need something handle most of my daily job.
5.not very security.the UI is too simple,not intuitively. very misleading.
